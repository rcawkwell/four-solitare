# Four Card Solitaire
Original project Goal: to learn python and implement a simple solitaire game.  Mostly works - Problem to fix: when there is an empty pile there runs into problems when discarding another card. The command-line version of the game be accessed/run from the command_line folder. The "foursolitaire.py" file in the main section is being converted for new implementation and doesn't run on the command line.

Beginning of the implementation of converting the command line python game to a web-based game using Flask and JQuery

The Game: A four card version of solitaire 
There are four piles. Every round a card is dealt to each pile from the deck. You can only discard cards based on the top of the piles. When all of the cards have been dealt from the deck the goal is to have only a king on each pile.
